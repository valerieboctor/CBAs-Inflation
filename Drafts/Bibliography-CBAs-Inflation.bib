The econometric model is estimated separately for five skill groups using a large panel data set formed from the U.S. Current Population Survey. The results suggest that unions raise wages more for workers with lower levels of observed skills. In addition, the patterns of selection bias differ by skill group. Among workers with lower levels of observed skill, unionized workers are positively selected, whereas union workers are negatively selected from among those with higher levels of observed skill.},

The empirical analysis, based on a large sample of indexed and nonindexed contracts, suggests that unexpected real wage changes are associated with systematic employment responses in the opposite direction. I conclude that nominal contracting provisions play a potentially important role in the cyclical properties and persistence of employment movements in the union sector.},

While the rational expectations revolution has allowed for great leaps in macroeconomic modeling, the surveyed empirical micro-evidence appears increasingly at odds with the full-information rational expectation assumption. We explore models of expectation formation that can potentially explain why and how survey data deviate from full-information rational  expectations. Using the New Keynesian Phillips curve as an extensive case study, we demonstrate how incorporating survey data on inflation expectations can address a number of otherwise  puzzling shortcomings that arise under the assumption of full-information rational expectations.},

The starting point of my analysis is a generalized version of Burdett and Mortensen's (1998) job ladder model featuring risk-neutral firms, risk-averse workers, and aggregate risk. Because of on-the-job search, my model generates wage rigidity both for incumbent workers, through standard insurance motives, and for new hires, through novel strategic complementarities in wage setting between firms. In contrast to the conventional wisdom in the macro literature, the introduction of on-the-job search implies that: (i) the wage rigidity of incumbent workers, rather than new hires, is the critical determinant of unemployment fluctuations; (ii) fairness considerations in wage setting dampen, rather than amplify, unemployment fluctuations; and (iii) new hire wages are too flexible, rather than too rigid, in the decentralized equilibrium. Quantitatively, the wage rigidity of incumbent workers caused by the insurance motive alone accounts for about one fifth of the unemployment fluctuations observed in the data.},

Our estimates indicate that the Phillips curve is very flat and was very flat even during the early 1980s. We estimate only a modest decline in the slope of the Phillips curve since the 1980s. We use a multi-region model to infer the slope of the aggregate Phillips curve from our regional estimates. Applying our estimates to recent unemployment dynamics yields essentially no missing disinflation or missing reinflation over the past few business cycles. Our results imply that the sharp drop in core inflation in the early 1980s was mostly due to shifting expectations about long-run monetary policy as opposed to a steep Phillips curve, and the greater stability of inflation since the 1990s is mostly due to long-run inflationary expectations becoming more firmly anchored.Institutional subscribers to the NBER working paper series, and residents of developing countries may download this paper without additional charge at www.nber.org.},

  abstract = {This paper studies how collective bargaining\textemdash a widespread labor market institution\textemdash affects firm compensation, i.e., the wages and job characteristics that are valuable to workers (henceforth amenities). Specifically, I leverage a reform that automatically extended all existing collective bargaining agreements (CBAs) in Brazil to analyze the impact of restricting employers' ability to phase out negotiated benefits on both wages and amenities. To quantify the value workers place on amenities secured by unions, I measure how textual elements in CBAs influence an establishment's ability to poach workers from other employers, conditional on wages, using data on the universe of CBAs merged with an administrative linked employer-employee dataset. The causal effects of the reform are estimated using a matched difference-in-difference design comparing establishments with extended CBAs to establishment belonging to firms that do not negotiate directly with unions. I find that automatic extensions increase compensation by 1.6-3.8\% in establishments with strong unions, which is driven by additional amenities whose value more than offsets foregone wage gains. These changes in firm compensation lead to an increase in hiring concentrated among low-skill workers, implying an elasticity of labor supply to establishments with strong unions of around 2. Further evidence indicates that the resulting wage and amenity distributions are compressed, suggesting that unions reduce compensation inequality within establishments.},

We show that this finding results from the aggregation of output impulse responses that differ sharply depending on the timing of the shock. When the monetary policy shock takes place in the first two quarters of the year, the response of output is quick, sizable, and dies out at a relatively fast pace. In contrast, output responds very little when the shock takes place in the third or fourth quarter. We propose a potential explanation for the differential responses based on uneven staggering of wage contracts across quarters. Using a dynamic general equilibrium model, we show that a realistic amount of uneven staggering can generate differences in output responses quantitatively similar to those found in the data.

  abstract = {This chapter reviews the role of temporary price and wage rigidities in explaining of the dynamic relationship between money, real output, and inflation. The key properties to be explained are that monetary shocks have persistent, but not permanent, effects on real output, and that the correlation between current output and inflation is positive for leads of inflation and negative for lags of inflation. The paper begins with a short empirical guide to price- and wage-setting behavior in market economies. It then compares alternative price- and wage-setting theories and argues that staggered contracts models continue to provide the most satisfactory match with the key macroeconomic facts. It then examines the microeconomic foundations of staggered contracts models and reviews some of their extensions and applications. Research in this area has been very active in the 1990s with a remarkable number of studies using, estimating, or testing models of staggered price and wage setting. A new generation of econometric models incorporating staggered price and wage setting with rational expectations has been built. Researchers have begun to incorporate staggered wage and price setting into real business cycle models. Close links have been discovered between the parameters of people's utility functions and the parameters of staggered price- and wage-setting equations. There is now a debate about whether standard calibrations of utility functions prevent staggered price models, at least those with frequent price changes, from explaining long persistence of real output. A theme of the paper is that the advent of rational expectations in the 1970s led to models of price and wage rigidities which were more amenable to empirical testing than earlier models, and this is one reason for the recent controversies and debates. There is much to be discovered from these debates and from the future research they stimulate.},
